It's been a long road since the start of this project. In March just before the world went in quarantine, I started working on the project. Seeing the everyone stay home and work or be out of a job for months trying to get in touch with unemployment really put a damper in my motivation but slowly but surely I slugged through it. At first, I thought this project was going to be easy and will take me no time at all to finish but I couldn't of been more wrong. It was way more complicated than anything I was shown prior or done before but with long thinking session I tackled each and every problem and solved them. When I thought I was done and was relieved until i realized after going throught the spec.md file that I didn't quite reach the requirements for the project so I had to firgure out a way to do that without having to completely start over. So I decided to add comments which filliled all the requirements. I feel like went way farther than I  had to do this project but I don't regret anything because I'm feel much more confident in my abilities and my ability to atleast figure out difficult things.
