I've been trying to become a programmer for a year now,  and for the longest time in the back of my mind I had my doubts about it. I went to school for Video Game Design and all my life I told myself I didn't want to program. After this project, I do actually think I can become a software developer. For the first time I was excited about programming and excited about solving a problem in my program. I finally saw how useful pry is, how objects actually work together and how git works. I went on a trip for a couple days and I kept having these "Aha!" moments that forced me to stop what I'm doing and write down everything. I'm really proud of my Fun Fact Generator and actually excited to work on the next project.
