A lot has happened between project two and project three. The pandemic showed signs of getting better but people got tired of having to deal with wearing a mask, not being able to see loved ones and overall just were tired of not having fun. Because of this we're in a much worse place. We did however get a new president, even though the old one is really trying to change that and all of this has really affected my code. It made coding project 3 take a lot longer because I've been exhausted watching the country implode on itself for no good reason. Anyway, I did finish project 3 and I learned many things, first being I really need to learn to downscale my projects because this one was a lot more work than I wanted. By the end I had upwards of 1000 lines of code with a ton of controllers, views routes, migrations and models but I don't regret doing it because I do feel like a better programmer now than when I started. I'm now using VS Code and not the learn IDE because the learn IDE literally didn't work for the project which was a pain to work through. Overall I feel like I can tackle much harder problems than I did prior and I'm really thankful for it but it did take 2 and a half months.
